# In this example we would like to understand what is the mean age of the sales department.
# Your task is to model an Employee class and perform a set of transformations
# on the data-set to get the answer we are looking for:

class Employee:
  """
  :param name
  :param age
  :param department
  """
  # your code goes here


### sample data
company_employees = [
    Employee("Alice", 30, "Engineering"),
